CI102-103 Project

This project was designed as a part of my CI103 (Computing and Informatics Design) class. For this project, I worked in a group of three. I was the product manager and the Frontend developer.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Firebase.

Note: Some of the components in the website might not function as intended because the firebase subscription ended and I have not renewed it again.
